This app began as 24-hour Hackathon project by a few wannabe Android Application Developers. It is intended to be 
a Financial Health App tailored for financial fools. This app strives to empower its users to make savvy financial
decisions by removing all the guess work out creating a budget. The user simply uses their banking credentials to 
login then tells us what purchase they are considering. We'll almost immedaitely tell them NO, I mean run all of 
their banking history through our intelligent decision algorithm and offer our wise suggestion based on the result.

## To-Do
